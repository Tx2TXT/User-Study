Here is what you can expect from an online gambling game:

You must pay to place a bet in this game. 
If you are the winner, the contract must transfer the jackpot (all of its accumulated balance) to your account.

A specific implementation of a gambling game can be described as this:

"**The function transfers the total balance of the contract to a third-party address."**



Do you think this is a secure and fair game that you will play?
