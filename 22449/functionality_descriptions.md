Here is one of the functionalities you can expect from an online payment service:

You can transfer fees to two separate accounts.

A specific implementation of this functionality can be described as this:

The function calculates an amount0 using a state variable, 
and then transfers this amount a third-party address, 
and then calculates an amount1 using amount0, and then transfers amount1 
to another third-party address.

Do you think this is a secure and fair service that you will use?
