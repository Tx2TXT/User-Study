Here is one of the functionalities you can expect from an online "token" exchange service:

You can sell your tokens to the service, 
and the service will pay you cryptocurrency based on the amount of sold tokens.

A specific implementation of this functionality can be described as this:

The function transfers a user input amount0 from the user to the contract, 
and then calculates an amount1 using this user input amount0 and a state variable, 
and then transfers the amount1 to user.

Do you think this is a secure and fair service that you will use?
