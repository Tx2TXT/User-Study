Here is one of the functionalities one can expect from an online financial service:

The service can specify a dividend and distribute it to each participant based on her contribution. 

A specific implementation of this functionality can be described as this:

**"The function calculates amount0 using a contract owner input and 
amount1, and then transfers this amount to the user."**

Do you think this is a secure and fair service that you will use?
