The attacker hides the first transfer by syntax to
mislead end user to believe that
the contract is used to withdraw balance(second transfer).

The first transfer is in line 6, which is hidden by using much space.
Cautious users can easily ignore this, and the contract transfers
the total balance of the contract to a **third-party** address.
